<h1> 4.1.4 Net Logo Firework Project <h1>
 <img src="images/fireworks.png" height="300">
	<h1> In this project, my partner Aya and I identified and asnwered questions to help us understand how this fireworks simulation work. By looking at the code and summary of the simulation, we figure out how the simulation ran.
The velocity at which a firework is shot up will affect the arch at which the rockets are shot up. X Velocity can shift rockets to shoot to the left or right, and the y-velocity changes the height of firework being shot.
Gravity also affects how high the fireworks will shoot up, and whether they continue going straight up when they explode or will have fragments coming down.<h1>
    <h1>  Rover Phone Home </h1>

	<h3> My partner Zaidoon and I have come to the conclusion that we think that the rover is located in the inland forest because our data supports it. The temperatures were smooth and only varied slightly, getting a little hotter during the day time. The light was somewhat high, but was still at a level that was ambient, and during the night it began to darken. The wind was howling earlier in the day, but a noticeable loud sound began to occur and caused a lot of noise which could be a thunderstorm. There was little wind as detected by the gyroscope and it only picked up a little bit, presumably due to the thunder storm. The graphs make sense and the data shows day night cycles, and the sound correlating with movement. The process was reasonable but I think that the amount of data collected is still not enough to fully know what the environment is, and the conditions we had to check did not provide enough context on what each region actually consisted of and was a bit ambiguous.
